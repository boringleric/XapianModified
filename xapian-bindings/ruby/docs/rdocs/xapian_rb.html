<h2>Underscore methods</h2>

<p>Note: Methods whose names start with an underscore character _ are internal
methods from the C++ API. Their functionality is not accessible in a
Ruby-friendly way, so this file provides wrapper code to make it easier to
use them from a Ruby programming idiom.  Most are also dangerous insofar as
misusing them can cause your program to segfault.  In particular, all of
Xapian’s *Iterator classes are wrapped into nice Ruby-friendly Arrays.</p>

<p>It should never be necessary to use any method whose name starts with an
underscore from user-level code. Make sure you are <em>VERY</em> certain
that you know exactly what you’re doing if you do use one of these methods.
Beware. You’ve been warned…</p>
